echo "Ok we need to take out the guards and proceed inside the
	building. We are looking for the core of the facility.
	There are going to be some hurdles for you to get past
	through, but first you need to get there. Use VIM to 
	delete the guards, which are marked by the \"g\" on the
	map, and unlock the gate to the facility. The gate is 
	marked by \"c\" on the map. You are going to need to 
	make it open by replacing \"c\" with a \"o\" character.
	We left you a validation script to see if your plan was
	correct course of action. Make sure to run after you are
	done with your plan."
