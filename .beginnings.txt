*You awake in a cold room that you don’t recognize. After inspecting the room and trying to figure out where you are, a voice speaks to you in your head* 

“Good morning agent, it seems the installation was a success. Don’t bother trying to try and remember who I am, we had to wipe your memory in order to make space for the new system in your brain. For now, call me Commander L.”  

*As he finishes speaking, you see different holographic menus appearing in front of you*  

“Our organization, Lincorp, has been developing the latest installment in cyber technology called “Linux”. You are the first human in the organization to have this installed in them.” 

 *As you play around with the menus, you notice occasional error messages and missing files* 

“I’ll cut right to the chase, although we installed Linux into you, it is not complete. Someone infiltrated our organization and was able to steal certain segments of the program for themself. I thought the best way to get those segments back and to test out the new system was to send you in. I do not expect you to be able to use Linux immediately, which is why these missions will help you learn and master it. When you’re ready, meet me in the debriefing room. I’ve sent the location of the room to your terminal.  

 *You hear a noise in your head and a map of the building appears and a room is marked with a star*
