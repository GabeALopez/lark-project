*Command L can be seen in the debriefing room* 

“Thanks to you and Professor Laika’s quick work, we were able to stop the breach in our servers and hold off the enemy’s attack. Your next mission is not as difficult as the others, you will be helping to repair the files that were corrupted during the breach. While you are doing that, Myself and a team are going to analyze the breach and find out who is behind all this. Professor Laika will be in the training room again to teach you the command that will help you repair the files.”
