“Good work on last Misson Agent, we have successfully installed the missing module into your Linux. The missing module you acquired contains the echo command. The next assignment I have for you will allow you to use it to its fullest. It is locked behind a highly secure area with sentry robots. Our team has attempted to recover this module before but were unable to do so because Microsop knew we were coming. Fortunately, they were able to obtain the password to turn off the security robots. \e[31mHead to the location and use this password to bring back the missing module. Before you leave, Professor Laika wants to give you training on the new command in the training room.\e[0m Head there before you embark on your mission. I expect great results.”  “Our enemy is an organization known as Microsop. They are a secret organization that has control over every system in the world. We have developed an alternative system in order to stop this monopoly, but we were found out. As for your mission, we have located one of the missing modules for Linux in a Microsop owned warehouse located in the city. Some of our spies tried to break into it but were unable to crack the lock on it and were found. With Linux, you should be able to get into it without the problem. To get to the warehouse, first exit this building to head into the city, then head towards the underground subway and take it to Hub Street. Lastly, go behind the tall skyscraper to get to the warehouse. Once you get into the warehouse and obtain the module, retrace your steps to come back here so we can install it into you. That is all for the mission debriefing. I’ll have to be on my way, I have another important task at hand. Professor Laika shall assist you with the commands you’ll need to break into the warehouse.
