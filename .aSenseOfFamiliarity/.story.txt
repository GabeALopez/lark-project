“Good work on last Misson Agent, we have successfully installed the missing module into your Linux. The missing module you acquired contains the echo command. The next assignment I have for you will allow you to use the echo command. We have the location of the last missing module for your Linux. It is locked behind a highly secure area with sentry robots. Our team has attempted to recover this module before but were unable to do so because our enemy knew we were coming. Fortunately, they were able to obtain the password to turn off the security robots. \e[31mHead to the location and use this password to bring back the missing module. Before you leave, Professor Laika wants to give you training on the new command in the training room.\e[0m Head there before you embark on your mission. I expect great results.”
