*You see Command L is in his favorite spot the debriefing room again to greet you. You wonder why he doesn’t call you to other places* 

“Good morning Agent, now that the servers are back up and running, we can finally bring the fight to our enemy. We were able to identify the location of Microsop’s secret base. 
Our team was also able to verify that the president of Microsop is also at this location, so we will be sending you to infiltrate the base and take out the president to finally put an end to Microsop’s reign. 
In order for you to be successful in your mission, professor Laika has activated a work in progress system that has been within you. The full name of it is too long in my opinion, so we like to call it VIM. 
Professor Laika has left you a manual to help assist you with VIM and to succeed in your mission. All of us on Lincorp are counting on you to complete this mission agent. See you on the other side.”
