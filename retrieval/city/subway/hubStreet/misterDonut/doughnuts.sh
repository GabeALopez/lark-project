echo "Instead of going to your misson to save the world, 
	you came here to eat donuts. After you ate one
	doughnut you kept eating after the other. 
	MORE!!! You screamed at the employee as he kept 
	giving you more and more doughnuts. The employee shaken
	with fear gave you the doughnuts. One scared customer
	and a police call later you are given a life sentence.
