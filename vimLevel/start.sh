	it would seem it is now time to take the fight to them.
	We are equiping you with a prototype of ours. The Virus
	Immobilization Machine or VIM for short. With this gadget
	you can can pretty much do anything. But it looks like 
	we might be just out of the time. We are getting close 
	to the drop off point. Get in there and have some fun.
	We will be waiting for on the other side."
